        <p>Meetup is all about helping people live fuller, happier livesâ€”with the help of strong communities. This means that all groups should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Provide growth opportunities for members
            </li>
            <li>
            Encourage real human interactions in person or online
            </li>
            <li>
            Have a host present at all events
            </li>
            <li>
            Be transparent about the group's intentions
            </li>
            <li>
            You can read more about all of this in our community guidelines.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
    Once you submit your group, a human at Meetup will review it based on these guidelines and make sure it gets promoted to the right people.
